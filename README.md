# NFT-Purchase-DAO

This is a DAO that exhibits the Good understanding of Blockchain Fundamentals
and advanced solidity topics.

This is a  Decentralized platform where any CryptoDev NFT Holder ( hold through my previous DAPP )
can create a proposal or vote for Proposal either in Yes or No.
The more NFTs you have , the more votes will be counted in.

Each proposal has a deadline of 5 minutes , associated with it.

If a proposal meets the deadline , it gets accepted or rejected based upon the number of votes for Yes or No !

### Precation
    
    Don't use your Mainnet Wallet Account
    Use Goerli Test Network
    Make sure to mint some NFTs from my Market place Dapp before continuing
